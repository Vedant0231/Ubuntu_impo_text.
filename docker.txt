#some important point for docker

what is docker?

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, 
update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine 
application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies 
required to run that code in any environment.

Containers simplify development and delivery of distributed applications. 
They have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native 
development and hybrid multicloud environments. It’s possible for developers to 
create containers without Docker, by working directly with capabilities built into 
Linux and other operating systems. But Docker makes containerization faster, easier and safer. 
At this writing, Docker reported over 13 million developers using the platform (link resides outside ibm.com)
